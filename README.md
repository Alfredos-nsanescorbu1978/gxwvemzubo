Just got out of Picture This and honestly, my head feels like it’s doing somersaults. You know that feeling when you eat way too many sour candies and your tongue gets all tingly and confused? Yeah, like that. My back's sore from the uncomfortable theater seats—felt like I was sitting on a medieval torture device, and this couple behind me kept yammering about their grocery list. Who even talks about cabbage at a time like this??

The   itself, tho. Wow. So many colors. Colors everywhere. Like a unicorn threw up all over the screen, except it was freaking beautiful??? Can’t even get the scene out of my head where the protagonist—what was their name again? Amy? Anna? Something with an A—runs through that forest. So green, the kind of green that makes you forget your taxes exists. Wasn’t the villain hilarious? His monologue made no sense—like a soggy piece of toast threatening a blender.

> And that music! Those violins? They were like...like a bunch of bees synchronizing swimming in honey. And that kid that popped up randomly on a skateboard? What was he even there for? Not complaining—he totally reminded me of my neighbor's cat who thinks he's a world explorer.

Did you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? Or was it Laurie who wanted to? Anyway, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Except maybe don’t because the first 20 minutes is basically a fever dream mixed with bad decisions. But then, boom, suddenly it makes sense. Kind of like that feeling when you find your keys in the fridge.

Text on the screen was weirdly poetic, like they got a poet in a blender with a computer. Popcorn crumbs everywhere now, I swear they multiply like rabbits in my hoodie pocket. And when, WHAM! That chase scene, felt like my heart was running a marathon, but it’s a donut shop marathon, so everyone’s happy??

def spaghetti_code():
    if not making_sense:
        try:
            print(Tomatoes everywhere)
        except:
            return Pickles?
    return half_eaten_tacos

Anyway, gotta re-adjust my brain. Felt like flying and drowning at the same time, if that’s even a thing. TTYL!
